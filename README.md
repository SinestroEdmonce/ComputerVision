# ComputerVision

### Introduction

A repository that is used to store the assignments from the course: ***Computer Vision***, which mostly includes code implementation for some specific questions.  

### Repository Architecture

1. The directory ``CV_Assignment_1`` contains three assignments, including the self-implemented convolution operation, the self-implemented global histogram equalization and the self-implemented local histogram equalization.

    ```
    CV_Assignment_1:
        - assignment_1_q2: convolution operation
            - CODE
        - assignment_1_q3_1: global histogram equalization
            - CODE
        - assignment_1_q3_2: local histogram equalization
            - CODE
        - resource
            - SOURCE IMAGE
        - results
            - PROCESSED IMAGE
    ```
